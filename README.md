# Blank

A blank starter theme for WordPress.

A very minimalistic starting point, with SCSS and browser-sync.

Feel free to use it however you want.

## Installation

To install dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

## Development

To watch for file changes and run browser-sync, run:

```
npm run dev
```

Please note that you'll need to edit the "browser-sync" script inside package.json, and change the URL to match your site.
